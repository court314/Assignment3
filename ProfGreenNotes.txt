Case 2 - Professor Green 

 
 

What data will be created or collected (type, size, format, etc.) 

Interdisciplinary primary care teams, team work in hospital environments 

Textual content analysis, 383 documents (teams, outcomes and practices) word, pdf, plain text and other. All are digital 

Conducting 15 interviews with key informants, 60 mins each, recorded as mp3 files, transcribed in microsoft word, asked q’s about how care teams work, concerned with loss of jobs, reputations. 

What licenses apply to the data 

Professor Green wants copyrights in place 

What facilities and equipment will be required (hard disk space, backup server, central repository, off-site repository, etc.) 

What data management practices (backups, storage, access control, archiving etc.) will be used 

Who will own and have access to the data 

Professor Green 

Which data will retain value after the life of the project 

What metadata and linked open data strategies will be employed 

Interviews conducted over the phone 

Languages: English, German, French 

How will its reuse be enabled and long-term preservation ensured after the original research is completed 

How much will the storage of this data cost (cloud and/or hard drives) 

 
 

Data Lifecycle 

Creating Data 

Design research 

Plan data management (formats, storage etc.) 

Plan consent for sharing 

Locate existing data 

Collect data (experiment, observe, measure, simulate) 

Capture and create metadata 

Processing Data 

Enter data, digitize, transcribe, translate 

Check, validate, clean data 

Anonymize data where necessary  

Interviews encrypted, anonymized, limited access 

Promised confidentiality to participants, small community, numeric identifications and legend stored separately. Secure database. 

Describe data 

Manage and store data 

Analysing Data 

Interpret data 

Derive data 

Produce research outputs 

Author publications 

Prepare data for preservation 

Preserving Data 

Migrate data to best format 

Migrate data to suitable medium 

Back-up and store data 

Storing data under zotero database 

Quantitative data stored in excel spreadsheet 

Suggest backup on secure cloud, USB not ideal to be travelling with Prof. Green 

Choose 3 options for data storage 

Create metadata and documentation 

15 interviews, each interview is an hour long, and I am encoding them in mp3 format, 128kbps = each file would be 57.6 mbs x 15= 864 mb 

Archive data 

Giving Access to Data 

Distribute data 

Share data 

With masters students and colleagues 

Zotero for documents, dropbox for audio, google docs for transcriptions 

Project meetings 

Binder of printed excel sheets -- MUST be digitized by MASTERS students w/ knowledge of health data, determine relevance. 

"The data is not shared with the public. As I mentioned, it can identify people. Share with my team are the notes I make (recordings, spreadsheets, text files) after I have gone through the data. And that is only shared with my project members. If they want more information, they have to ask me."  

Control access SEE ABOVE, only Prof. Green has full access to data 

Establish copyright 

Promote data 

Re-using Data 

Follow-up research 

New research 

Undertake research reviews 

Scrutinize findings 

Teach and learn 

 
 

Case 2 - Professor Green  

you know we have a mix document files (PDF, Word and plain text). Could you tell us the average size of those documents?  

"the file size ranges from a few hundred kilobytes to 25-30MB."  

Could you please provide us the name or the code for each hospital that you are planning to examining   

"I work with a few hospitals in Nova Scotia, one hospital in France, one in Germany and a few more in Calgary."  

This case did not mentioned the size of some data collection , how we can know the data size?   

"You are the expert! There are 15 interviews, each interview is an hour long, and I am encoding them in mp3 format, 128kbps."  

Is the data that was collected in 2002 related to the data that was mentioned in this case?  

"There might something relevant in the 2002 binder with the printed spreadsheets. I would like for you to look through it. It does not contain anything that can identify participants. "  

Is there a specific size for the zotero database ? Also,how much space do you wish to have for your future research (How much do you think you'll use in 5 years from now?  

"the current size of all my files right now fits in my USB drive which is 64GB and it is not full. There are about 40GB left over. I predict that the data influx will increase in the near future. My research is very important! You say five years? It will be at least ten. I predict it will triple in size."  

There are 383 documents with several formats. Would you like to have them available on the original format or would you be willing to have one standard format for your database ?  

"Why would I want them in one format? Do you plan on changing my original data??"  

'll make use of a specific data storage service. As a Dal faculty member you can make use of the university's space to store your data. Is Dal's repository ok, or do you have any specific preference ?  

"the Dal repository is fine for now, but I would like to know what other options are available. Not too many, two or three would be good."  

If you are required to share interview instruments or anonymized data to conduct your studies, how is this done? What is the language of communication?   

"I am not required to share the original files or interviews. Only information that does not allow for subject identification. That data needs to be translated to the official language of each collaborator's location."  

Please send us a copy of the participant consent form so that we can fully understand the terms of confidentiality and ensure that we don’t breach them.

You mentioned earlier that you expect to get a new grant once your current funding runs out. It would be helpful to know who provides your research funding so we can ensure the data management plan we are developing for you adheres to that funder's policies.  

my funding comes from CIHR (Canadian Institutes of Health Research). 

What is the reason that you have your transcriptions stored on Google Drive? Are members of the team doing live collaboration to edit those transcriptions? 

no, I simply like to have quick access to the information, even when I am not on my computer in my office. 

The founding comes from CIHR. Are you working in the Dalhousie or in the Century University? because the consent form shows that you are from Century University and I would like to make sure about that . 

I am working at Dalhousie. The consent form is a general template for consent forms. 

We would like to confirm that the data from the data healthcare providers and internal networks is the same as the open data sets you have collected. What is the type of data and format of the open data sets that you use in your research? 

yes, they are the same. The open data is in tsv files. The type of data is explained in my original briefing file.
