Case 2 - Professor Green  

you know we have a mix document files (PDF, Word and plain text). Could you tell us the average size of those documents?  

"the file size ranges from a few hundred kilobytes to 25-30MB."  

Could you please provide us the name or the code for each hospital that you are planning to examining   

"I work with a few hospitals in Nova Scotia, one hospital in France, one in Germany and a few more in Calgary."  

This case did not mentioned the size of some data collection , how we can know the data size?   

"You are the expert! There are 15 interviews, each interview is an hour long, and I am encoding them in mp3 format, 128kbps."  

Is the data that was collected in 2002 related to the data that was mentioned in this case?  

"There might something relevant in the 2002 binder with the printed spreadsheets. I would like for you to look through it. It does not contain anything that can identify participants. "  

Is there a specific size for the zotero database ? Also,how much space do you wish to have for your future research (How much do you think you'll use in 5 years from now?  

"the current size of all my files right now fits in my USB drive which is 64GB and it is not full. There are about 40GB left over. I predict that the data influx will increase in the near future. My research is very important! You say five years? It will be at least ten. I predict it will triple in size."  

There are 383 documents with several formats. Would you like to have them available on the original format or would you be willing to have one standard format for your database ?  

"Why would I want them in one format? Do you plan on changing my original data??"  

'll make use of a specific data storage service. As a Dal faculty member you can make use of the university's space to store your data. Is Dal's repository ok, or do you have any specific preference ?  

"the Dal repository is fine for now, but I would like to know what other options are available. Not too many, two or three would be good."  

If you are required to share interview instruments or anonymized data to conduct your studies, how is this done? What is the language of communication?   

"I am not required to share the original files or interviews. Only information that does not allow for subject identification. That data needs to be translated to the official language of each collaborator's location."  

Please send us a copy of the participant consent form so that we can fully understand the terms of confidentiality and ensure that we don’t breach them.

You mentioned earlier that you expect to get a new grant once your current funding runs out. It would be helpful to know who provides your research funding so we can ensure the data management plan we are developing for you adheres to that funder's policies.  

my funding comes from CIHR (Canadian Institutes of Health Research). 

What is the reason that you have your transcriptions stored on Google Drive? Are members of the team doing live collaboration to edit those transcriptions? 

no, I simply like to have quick access to the information, even when I am not on my computer in my office. 

The founding comes from CIHR. Are you working in the Dalhousie or in the Century University? because the consent form shows that you are from Century University and I would like to make sure about that . 

I am working at Dalhousie. The consent form is a general template for consent forms. 

We would like to confirm that the data from the data healthcare providers and internal networks is the same as the open data sets you have collected. What is the type of data and format of the open data sets that you use in your research? 

yes, they are the same. The open data is in tsv files. The type of data is explained in my original briefing file.

WHAT I HAVE SO FAR
Professor Green 

Data description 

Dr. Green is currently working on a project with two Masters students. In this project, Dr. Green and his team has two methods of data collection. The first is a textual analysis of 383 documents and the second is conducting interviews. This project will collect textual data which consists of a mix of document formats as well quantitative data stored in an excel spreadsheet. The project will produce data in the form of interviews will be conducted over the phone, requiring MP3 files and transcribed to Microsoft word. Dr. Green also uses open data sets regarding healthcare in his research.  

Access and Sharing (section needs work) 

Need help with what repository to use. 

The data created as a result of the interviews is sensitive. Dr. Green has stated that the data for his experiment is not to be shared with anyone. The data will be deposited into (repository?) and the data will have restricted access controlled by Dr. Green.  

Notes recorded by Dr. Green himself will be made accessible to his Masters students.  

Metadata 

Metadata for Dr. Green's project will be tagged in XML using the Data Documentation Inititiative format. This is a widely used international standard for describing data from both social and science fields. Metadata about data will be recorded to give Dr. Green context about what the file contains. 

Intellectual Property Rights 

Dr. Green will hold intellectual property rights for all research data and information directly created by the project.  

Ethics and Privacy 

To protect the privacy of informants, Dr. Green will use an informed consent form. The form states that the researcher will not identify the participant by name in any information resulting from the interview and that confidentiality will be secure. Data will be subject to the standard practice of anonymizing data to ensure privacy. During analysis and storage, only Dr. Green and approved members of his research team will be allowed to access data. The research team will then remove any direct identifiers before it is deposited into the storage repository.  

Format 

Data collection of the documents for textual analysis have been obtained from healthcare organizations and quantitative information regarding these documents will be recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using DDI XML metadata documentation. Phone interviews will be recorded as MP3 file format.  

To insure preservation of data, it is suggested that the document files and transcripts of interviews be converted to one file format of PDF. This will ensure that documents can be accessed in the future and will preserve the data as it is, meaning that it cannot be altered. PDF provides a high level data encryption and offers a secure way to transfer data over the internet. Dr. Green can customize the user access level, setting it so he is the only one who can access the files and add a digital signature. A digital signature confirms the authenticity of the text and protect Dr. Green's work. 

Archiving and Preservation / Storage and Backup 

To ensure that the data created by Dr. Green's project is accessible for future use, data will be deposited in (repository) and will be backed up on an external USB key. Dr. Green's Masters students will be tasked with migrating research data to new formats, platforms, and storage as required for the continuation of his research. A master copy of each file will be contained in the USB Key, as well a backup on the repository to ensure digital preservation.  

Security 

The data files from Dr. Green's research project will be managed, processed, an stored in a secure enviroment by the researcher himself. To ensure security, we will install a lockable computer system on his laptop that has a strong firewall system with software to protect from viruses/malware. The folder containing files for his project will be encrypted and password protected. Any identifying information about the informants will be anonymized. 

Responsibility 

Dr. Green has assigned us to be the data manager to act as steward for the data throughout the data lifecylce. At the conclusion of the current grant, we will give all data management plan documentations to the new assigned data manager. 

Existing Data 

There is currently a binder of printed excel spreadsheets, it is our recommendation that Dr. Green's trained Masters students go through to find any relevant data to the current research. We will then provide the students with step by step instructions of how to digitize relevant data.
